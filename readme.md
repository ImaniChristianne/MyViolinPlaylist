# Project: MyViolinPlaylist

By Christianne Maene

## Introduction

The idea behind MyVioLinPlaylist is to create a classical musical playlist that can be adopted on a violin. The playlist provides information on the artist, year, albums, and tracks of the playlist. Apart from that, it also provides a purchase description field where the sheet music can be purchased. 

## Design 

Anything that can be done in the application can also be done in the database that is mainly accessed through NMAP's phpMyAdmin. The application design is a Windows GUI with a button to load music albums, and search for specific albums. It also allows for adding new albums right from the application. It shows the front page of the selected album. It also plays the video of the selected track.

## Schema

As shown in the above fighure, there are two tables that are connected by the albums_ID foreign key. This is a one to many relationship where one album can have many tracks. 

## Tools & SQL

There were several tools used to build and run this application. They are listed in the references section at the bottom of the page. SQL files end in .sql. Files generated by VS end in .cs. 

## Data

All the loaded data can be found in music.sql. This is where album data and tracks data are found inserted with sql queries. 

## Queries

There are so many queries behind this application. Most of these queries can be found in the database application phpMyAdmin. The same queries can also be found in the program files from Visual Studio. I give examples of each kind of query that is found in this application. 

1. Create Table Queries

These can be found in music.sql. They are used to create the two tables albums and tracks.

2. Insert Queries

These are used to insert information into the tables. They can also be found in music.sql.

3. Delete Queries

These can be found in AlbumsDAO.cs. They are used to delete information from the table.

4. Search Queries

These can also be found in AlbumsDAO.cs. They are used for the search feature in the application.

## More

* phpMyAdmin is a wonderful tool to both host a database and help generate queries. Its in-built queries are a great starter for more complicated queries.
